# URL Shortener

URL shortening is used to generate short aliases for long URLs. Users will redirect to the original URL when they hit short links. Also, these short links simplify a lot of spaces while sharing the message. Additionally, users are less likely to mistype shorter URLs.

For example,
<br/>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;[https://blog.ranmanic.in/opensource](https://blog.ranmanic.in/opensource)

we would get,
<br/>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;[https://rm.in/os](https://blog.ranmanic.in/opensource)

It is used to optimize links across devices, tracking individual links and, hiding affiliated original URLs.
